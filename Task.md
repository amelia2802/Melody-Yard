Scenario:
Everyone loves sharing music with friends. No matter how good an algorithm gets, your friends know your music taste best! You are tasked with designing an app for creating playlists and sharing them with friends.

Task:
Present 3-6 polished visual designs of screens from the playlist app.

Screens could include:
A playlist screen with a unique header, a description, and a list of songs
A profile page with a profile picture, username, bio, and favourite artists listed
A feed screen with all of the music that your friends are listening to 
A comment section below a playlist for friends to leave each other comments
A song screen with one song playing and the next songs queued up
A discover page to discover new playlists shared publicly on the app
Success looks like:
3-6 polished visual designs for a social music app
Visual designs presented together on a few slides with contextual callouts pointing out design decisions and key features of the app
